# TODO:

- clean up process.py into its own class
- let scrapy logic be a subset of that
- abstract serialization and loading of network class
  - will need to do when checking S3 for results
- look into modifying pyvis or VisJS code

## Concerns:

There are a few potential problems that you may encounter if you create a website like en.wikivis.org and allow users to replace "wikipedia" with "wikivis" in the URL to access your website. Here are some potential issues to consider:

- Legal issues: You could be infringing on the trademarks or copyrights of the Wikimedia Foundation or Wikipedia if you use their logo, name, or content on your website without their permission.
  User experience: Your website may not provide the same level of information and usability as the original Wikipedia site. Users may find it difficult to navigate or understand the information presented on your website.

- Data accuracy: The information presented on your website may be inaccurate or outdated. Unlike Wikipedia, which relies on a community of editors to maintain its accuracy and completeness, your website may not have the same level of scrutiny or oversight.

- Technical issues: Your website may have technical issues that prevent it from working properly, such as slow loading times, broken links, or other errors. This could result in a poor user experience or even prevent users from accessing your website altogether.

- Security issues: Your website may be vulnerable to security risks such as hacking, malware, or other types of cyber attacks. This could compromise the privacy and security of your users' data.

In summary, while creating a website like en.wikivis.org may seem like a good idea, there are several potential issues to consider, including legal, user experience, data accuracy, technical, and security issues. If you do decide to create such a website, it is important to carefully consider these issues and take steps to address them to ensure a positive user experience and avoid legal or other problems.
